# webpack-practice

This is a Front End Development setup taken from Brad Traversy's "Webpack 5 Crash Course".
I followed along and built the setup in order to get a better understanding of Webpack, and to have the setup available for future use.

Setup includes:
- Webpack setup
- Webpack Dev Server
- HTML Webpack Plugin
- Sass Compiling
- Babel Transpiling
- Asset Resource Loaders
- Analyzer Plugin
- Source Maps
